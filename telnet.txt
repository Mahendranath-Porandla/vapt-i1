Aim:

The aim of "sniffing" in a cyber security context is to intercept and analyze network traffic (packets) to gain insights, troubleshoot issues, and steal sensitive data. capturing plaintext credentials transmitted over insecure protocols such as POP3, FTP, and Telnet.
Procedure :
FTP:
FTP operates at the application layer of the OSI model (Level 7) and allows users to upload and download files as well as manage files and directories on a remote server. Communication between the FTP client and the FTP server occurs over two separate channels:
Execution steps;
1.  Open terminal
2.  Change into ftp shell
3 .  >ftp
4 .  ftp>open
       to  host name
        enter username and password
  Telnet:
Telnet (short for TELecommunication NETwork) is a text-based protocol used for remote login to servers, network devices, and other systems. It allows users to execute commands on a remote machine over a network.
•	Operates on port 23 by default.
•	Uses a command-line interface (CLI) for remote administration.
•	No graphical interface, making it lightweight.
•	Enables remote control of systems and devices.
1.  Open terminal
2.  Change into telnet shell
3 .  >telnet
4 .  telnet>open
       to  host name
        enter username and password

POP3:
POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) is a standard email protocol used to retrieve emails from a mail server to a local device. It allows users to download emails and read them offline.
 Default Port:
•	POP3 (Unencrypted) → Port 110
 How POP3 Works
1.	Client connects to the mail server via port 110 (or 995 for POP3S).
2.	Authentication occurs using a username and password.
3.	Emails are downloaded to the local device.
4.	Emails are usually deleted from the server after download (unless configured otherwise).
Key features
1. Packet Capture
2. Clear text Credential Extraction
•	POP3 (Port 110): Captures USER and PASS credentials from email clients.
•	FTP (Port 21): Extracts usernames and passwords from FTP authentication.
•	Telnet (Port 23): Sniffs remote login credentials as Telnet transmits in plaintext.
 3. Protocol-Specific Filtering
•	Attackers apply Wireshark filters like: 
o	tcp.port == 110 (POP3)
o	tcp.port == 21 (FTP)
o	tcp.port == 23 (Telnet)
•	Search for USER, PASS, or authentication-related strings.
4. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack Support
•	Attackers can redirect or intercept traffic using: 
o	ARP Spoofing (e.g., using ettercap)
o	DNS Spoofing to trick users into connecting via an attacker-controlled path.
5. Real-time or Offline Analysis
•	Live Sniffing: Monitor traffic in real time.
•	Offline Analysis: Save packet captures (.pcap files) for later examination.
