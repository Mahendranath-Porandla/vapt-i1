Experiment 3: Vulnerability Scanning (OpenVAS/GVM)

Aim: Install and use GVM/OpenVAS to scan a target for vulnerabilities.

Tool: Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) on Kali Linux.

Prerequisites: Kali Linux, sudo/root access, stable internet, sufficient RAM/disk space.

Installation & Setup (Kali Terminal):

Update System:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

sudo apt install gvm -y

Run Setup (LONG PROCESS):
sudo gvm-setup
(CRITICAL: Save the admin password shown at the end!)

Check Setup (Repeat until OK):
sudo gvm-check-setup
(Follow any instructions it gives)

Start GVM Services:
sudo gvm-start

Using the Web Interface (GSA):

Access URL: Open Firefox IN KALI and go to: https://127.0.0.1:9392

Accept Security Warning: Click Advanced -> Accept Risk and Continue.

Login:

Username: admin

Password: The one saved during gvm-setup.

Running a Scan:

Create Target:

Go to Configuration -> Targets -> New Target icon.

Enter Name (e.g., "My Scan Target").

Enter Hosts (target IP address, e.g., Metasploitable's IP or 127.0.0.1).

Save.

Create & Run Task:

Go to Scans -> Tasks -> New Task icon.

Enter Name (e.g., "Scan My Target").

Select the Scan Target you created.

Choose Scan Config (e.g., "Full and fast").

Save.

Find the task in the list and click the green "Play" (â–º) icon to start.

Results:

Monitor scan progress on the Tasks page.

When "Done", click the date under "Last Report" to view vulnerabilities by severity.

Stop GVM (Optional):

In terminal: sudo gvm-stop
